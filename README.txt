This program runs a game called pig, normally played with dice, 
between a human and computer opponent. Players take turns 
until the score limit is reached. The human player goes 
first and a dice roll is simulated. If a 1 is rolled then
the player's turn is over and no points are gained, any other 
dice roll is added to the player's score for the current turn 
and he/she may choose to roll again or end the turn. If a player 
ends their turn the points earned during the current turn
are added to his/her total. The computer simulates an opponent's turn
and only chooses to end the turn if it scores more than 20 
points. Play continues until the human or computer scores
100 or more points.
